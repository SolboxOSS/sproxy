DAVFS2 1.4.6 INSTALLATION
=========================

    1 UPDATING FROM PREVIOUS VERSION
    2 INSTALLATION
        2.1 PREREQUISITE
        2.2 INSTALLATION FROM CVS SOURCES
        2.3 INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE PACKAGE
    3 UNINSTALL
    

1 UPDATING FROM PREVIOUS VERSION
================================

'make install' copies new versions of davfs2.conf and secrets
into /usr/local/etc/davfs2 or /etc/davfs2 and creates a backup of the
existing files. You will have to merge your changes from the backup
into the new files.

When a user invokes the new version of mount.davfs the first time, it
will only copy new versions of davfs2.conf and secrets into ~/.davfs2,
if this files do not exist. The user should rename this files before
invoking mount.davfs. After the new configuration files have been
installed the user may merge the changes form the old files into
the new versions.


UPDATING FROM 1.0.x
-------------------

In davfs2 1.1.0 the organization of the permanent cache has changed
compared to the 1.0.x releases and the cache needs to be rebuild. Files
in the backup directory will be lost. So before installing the new version,
you should start your old version of mount.davfs a last time and save all
the files from the backup directory you may need some day.


2 INSTALLATION
==============

2.1 PREREQUISITE
----------------

davfs2 uses the neon libraries for communication with the server.
libneon (2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 or 2.9) must be installed. Your distribution will most
likely provide a package.
You will also need the neon header files. Distributions usually provide
development packages for this.
If your distribution don't come with libneon or it does not support TLS and
large files, you may build your own neon library. You can get it from
http://www.webdav.org/neon/

Your kernel must include either the coda file system or the fuse file system
or both. They may be loadable modules. Almost all Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernels
support at least one of them.


2.2 INSTALLATION FROM CVS SOURCES
---------------------------------

To build davfs2 from the CVS sources you need recent versions of the some
build tools:

- GNU Autoconf 2.61 or newer
- GNU Automake 1.10 or newer
- GNU gettext-tools 0.16.1 or newer
- po4a 0.29 or newer

Change into the top level source directory and run
    $ ./bootstrap
    This will add some necessary files, create the configure script and the
    Makefile.in's, and build the translated man pages from the po-files.

Proceed with Installation from Source Package.


2.3 INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE PACKAGE
------------------------------------

From within the top level source directory:

- Run the configure script.
    $ ./configure [options]
    This will test your system and finally create the appropriate Makefiles.
    You may add some options or set some variables, but hopefully will not
    have to.

    Options and variables:
    ----------------------

    --prefix=<prefix>
        Defines the directory where davfs2 will be installed. It defaults to
        '/usr/local'. If your sources came with your distribution it may
        be '/usr'.

    --with-neon=<directory>
        Directory where to find the neon library and the neon headers.
        Default is to first try /usr/local and then /usr. If you just have
        neon libraries in /usr/lib and headers in /usr/include, you don't
        need this.

    --disable-nls
        Disable the support for national languages.

    LINGUAS="ll ll ll"
        A list of two-letter language codes. This will select which of the
        available translations of messages and documentation will be installed.
        ll must be in lower case.

    dav_user=<davfs2>
        A system user without shell. mount.davfs will run with this id when
        invoked by root. Default dav_user is "davfs2".

    dav_group=<davfs2>
        A system group. mount.davfs will be member of this group. Normal users
        must be member of this group in order to mount. Default dav_group is
        "davfs2".
    
    ./configure --help will show all available options.
        
- Run make.
    $ make
    This will compile the program.

- Gain root permissions and run make install.
    # make install
    This will copy all the files in the appropriate directory.
    Note: 'mount.davfs' will be setuid root!

- Create the system user 'davfs2' and group 'davfs2' if they not yet exist.
  The system user should not have a shell. Proposed home directory is
  '/var/cache/davfs2'.

- Get rid of the root permissions.


3 UNINSTALL
===========

To uninstall davfs2 the sources have to be configured just the same way
they were configured for installation.

From within the top level source directory run with root permissions
    # make uninstall
    This will remove all the installed files.

Note: The directories will not be removed.
      Files and directories created by mount.davfs at run-time will *not* be
      removed too.
      This are: pid-files (in /var/run/mount.davfs), cache files and
      directories (in /var/cache/davfs2) and all the files in the users
      home directories in .davfs2.
      This files have to be removed manually.
